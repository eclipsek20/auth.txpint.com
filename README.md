This is a main authentication part of my api.txpint.com, all solutions I looked at where too expensive, brought too much unessecary feature or had terrible documenation. The solution I created here is best for implementing an api the easy way.

TODO:
-Add universal error numbers instead of displaying number
-Make production changes and make a seperate branch {you can do this yourself}

RECCOMENED IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT USING THIS:
-Edit the error codes to be more generic, remove the raw error outputs 
-Change the DB to MySQL/MariaDB (otherwise I wish you well)
-Tweak it to your use-case

For anyone other than me this code is more of a boilerplate but like any boilerplate it has infinite possibilities.
