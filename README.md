This is a main authentication part of my api.txpint.com, all solutions I looked at were too expensive, brought too much necessary feature or had terrible documentation. The solution I created here is best for implementing an API the easy way.

TODO:

-Add universal error numbers instead of displaying number

-Make production changes and make a separate branch {you can do this yourself}

RECOMMENDED IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT USING THIS:

-Edit the error codes to be more generic, remove the raw error outputs 

-Change the DB to MySQL/MariaDB (otherwise I wish you well)

-Tweak it to your use-case

-Change the public keys

For anyone other than me this code is more of a boilerplate but like any boilerplate it has infinite possibilities.
